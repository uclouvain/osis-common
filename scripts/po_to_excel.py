"""
Import all data from the .po files (translation files) to a .xlsl file (excel file).
The format of the excel file is the following one:

KEY ENGLISH_TRANSLATION  FRENCH_TRANSLATION   ENGLISH_MODIFIED_TRANSLATION FRENCH_MODIFIED_TRANSLATION

Where KEY is the "msgid" value of the .po files.
ENGLISH_TRANSLATION  and FRENCH_TRANSLATION are the "msgstr" values of the english and french .po files
respectively.
ENGLISH_MODIFIED_TRANSLATION and FRENCH_MODIFIED_TRANSLATION are empty columns used to write correction of the
english and french translations of the .po files.
